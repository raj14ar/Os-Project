It’s a process scheduling mechanism done by the scheduler in the operating systems. According to the given scheduling approach it’s a non-preemptive( it is not moved from running queue without the process requesting it), shortest job first in nature approach (in which the shortest job is given the most priority) but here we also have to consider the waiting time of each and every processes, the process which has been waiting for a long time is increased with its priority which prevents the case of starvation on the basis of the formula given in the question i.e: Priority=1+Waiting time/ Estimated runtime.
